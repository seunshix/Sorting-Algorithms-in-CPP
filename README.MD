### Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains the implementation of several commonly used data structures and sorting algorithms in computer science. The implemented algorithms include:

#### Binary Search Trees (BST)
Binary search trees (BSTs) are a data structure that maintain an ordered collection of elements. BSTs are organized in such a way that each node has a parent and two children, with the property that all nodes in the left subtree have smaller values than the parent, and all nodes in the right subtree have larger values.

#### Heapsort
Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by transforming the input array into a max heap, and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element and re-heapifying the remaining elements. Heapsort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).

#### Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. Insertion sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).

#### Mergesort
Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input array into two halves, recursively sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves together. Mergesort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).

#### Quicksort
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other
