## Introduction
This code is an implementation of a binary search tree (BST) in C++. A BST is a type of data structure that allows for fast searching, insertion, and deletion of elements. This code uses recursion for its implementation and contains functions for inserting nodes, deleting nodes, displaying the tree, searching for elements, and finding the height of the tree.

## Dependencies
- iostream
- conio.h
- ctime
- fstream
- cstdlib
- iomanip
- math.h
- vector
- random
- string

## Classes
BST: The BST class contains the main functions for the BST.
- insertNode: This function inserts a new node with the specified data into the tree.
- deleteNode: This function deletes the node with the specified data from the tree.
- display: This function displays the elements of the tree in order.
- search: This function searches for the node with the specified data in the tree.
- depth: This function returns the height of the tree.

## Main Function
The main function creates an instance of the BST class and then calls various functions to perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching.

## Input
The input is read from the file "BST.inputFile.txt". The file contains the elements to be inserted into the tree.

## Conclusion
This code serves as a basic implementation of a BST and can be used as a starting point for further development or as a reference for understanding the functioning of a BST.
