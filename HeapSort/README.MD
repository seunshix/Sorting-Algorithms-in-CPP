## Heap Sort
A C++ implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm to sort an input array of integers.

## Dependencies
- iostream - Standard input/output library in C++.
- conio.h - Console input/output header file in C.
- ctime - C-style time and date library in C++.
- fstream - C++ file input/output library.
- cstdlib - Standard C library.
- iomanip - I/O manipulator library in C++.
- math.h - Mathematical functions library in C.
- vector - C++ Standard Template Library container for arrays.
- random - C++ random number generation library.
- string - C++ string library.
- chrono - C++ time and date library.

## Input
A file called HeapSort.inputFile.txt containing 100,000 random integers.

## Output
The sorted array of integers in the HeapSort.inputFile.txt file, and the time taken to sort the array.

## Functionality
The code uses the Heap Sort algorithm to sort the integers stored in the HeapSort.inputFile.txt file. The file is created and populated with 100,000 random integers, and the contents of the file are then read into a C++ vector container. The heapSort function is used to sort the vector of integers, and the time taken to sort the array is recorded using the chrono library. The sorted array is then printed to the console.

## Usage
To run the code, compile the code using a C++ compiler and run the resulting executable file. The sorted array of integers and the time taken to sort the array will be printed to the console.
